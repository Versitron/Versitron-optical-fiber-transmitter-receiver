## üîç What Is an Optical Fiber Transmitter and Receiver?

An **optical fiber transmitter** converts electrical signals (like video or data) into light signals, which are sent over fiber optic cables. At the receiving end, an **optical fiber receiver** converts the light signals back into usable electrical signals. These systems are used to extend connectivity over long distances ‚Äî often up to 100 km or more ‚Äî with zero signal degradation.
